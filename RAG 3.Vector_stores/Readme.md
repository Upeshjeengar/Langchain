## Vector Store
A vector store is a system designed to store and retrieve data represented as numerical vectors.
## Key Features
1. Storage Ensures that vectors and their associated metadata are retained, whether in-memory for quick lookups or on-disk for durability and large-scale use.
2. Similarity Search - Helps retrieve the vectors most similar to a query vector.
3. Indexing - Provide a data structure or method that enables fast similarity searches on high-dimensional vectors (e.g., approximate nearest neighbor lookups).
4. CRUD Operations - Manage the lifecycle of data-adding new vectors, reading them, updating existing entries, removing outdated vectors.
## Use-cases
1. Semantic Search
2. RAG
3. Recommender Systems
4. Image/Multimedia search

### Vector Store
* Typically refers to a lightweight library or service that focuses on storing vectors (embeddings) and performing similarity search.  
* May not include many traditional database features like transactions, rich query languages, or role-based access control.  
* Ideal for prototyping, smaller-scale applications  
* Examples: FAISS (where you store vectors and can query them by similarity, but you handle persistence and scaling separately).
### Vector Database
* A full-fledged database system designed to store and query vectors.  
* Offers additional "database-like" features:
  - Distributed architecture for horizontal scaling
  - Durability and persistence (replication, backup/restore)
  - Metadata handling (schemas, filters)
  - Potential for ACID or near-ACID guarantees
  - Authentication/authorization and more advanced security
* Geared for production environments with significant scaling, large datasets

### Vector Stores in LangChain
* Supported Stores: LangChain integrates with multiple vector stores (FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma, Qdrant, Weaviate, etc.), giving you flexibility in scale, features, and deployment.
* Common Interface: A uniform Vector Store API lets you swap out one backend (e.g., FAISS) for another (e.g., Pinecone) with minimal code changes.
* Metadata Handling: Most vector stores in LangChain allow you to attach metadata (e.g., timestamps, authors) to each document, enabling filter-based retrieval.

examples(common to all databases):  
from_documents(...) or from_texts(...)
add_documents(...) or add_texts(...)
similarity_search(query, k=...)
